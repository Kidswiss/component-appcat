= Minio

Installing Minio and generating the providerconfigs can be managed via the component.

This setup has multiple parts to it:

* provider
* composition functions
* deployments via composition function

== Provider

The provider section `appcat.provider.minio` can take multiple variations of provider configs:

* By referencing an existing provider config by name
* By creating additional configs through the `additionalProviderConfigs` field
* Automatically injected configs from the `appcat.services.vshn.minio.instance`` field

== Composition Function

The composition here is very bare bones, the whole composition is via functions.
The compositions are generated depending on how many provider configs there are.
Each composition will handle exactly one provider config.
This is the mechanism we can use so that a user can choose between different minio instances.
We already use this mechanism to choose between different clouds for the `ObjectBuckets`.
The default composition can easily be set.

== Deployment

Via `appcat.services.vshn.minio.instance` it's possible to deploy arbitrary amounts of minio instances to a cluster.
As mentioned above, the provider configs will then be injected automatically and new compositions are generated accordingly.
