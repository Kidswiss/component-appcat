[[memoryCritical]]
== MemoryCritical

The instance uses more than 85% of the memory limit set on the pod.
A further increase in memory usage might lead to the pod being OOM-killed by Kubernetes.

Either adjust the limits of the affected instance or reduce the workload on the instance to lower memory consumption (this depends highly on the used service).
