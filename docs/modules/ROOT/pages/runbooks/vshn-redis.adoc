= Redis by VSHN


[[uptime]]
== Uptime

[IMPORTANT]
We don't yet have a lot of operational experience with this service.
If you received this alert, please add any insights you gained to improve this runbook.

=== icon:glasses[] Overview

The SLI measures the uptime of each Redis by VSHN instance.
This SLI is measured by a prober that executes a `Ping` every second.

If this SLI results in an alert, it means that a significant number of `pings` failed and that we risk missing the SLO.

There are two types of alerts that fire if we expect to miss the configured objective.

* A ticket alert means that the error rate is slightly higher than the objective.
If we don't intervene at some point after receiving this alert, we can expect to miss the objective.
However, no immediate, urgent action is necessary.
A ticket alert should have a label `severity: warning`.
* A page alert means that the error rate is significantly higher than the objective.
Immediate action is necessary to not miss the objective.

==== Debugging Redis Instance

If the instance is synced, but still not running, we'll need to look at the redis pods themselves.

First see if the pods are running.

[source,shell]
----
export INSTANCE_NAMESPACE=$(kubectl -n $NAMESPACE get vshnredis $NAME -o jsonpath="{.status.instanceNamespace}")
kubectl --as cluster-admin -n $INSTANCE_NAMESPACE get pod
----

If they're running, check the logs if there are any obvious error messages

[source,shell]
----
kubectl --as cluster-admin -n $INSTANCE_NAMESPACE sts/redis-master
----

If you can't see any pods at all, then there might be an issue with the statefulset (eg. faulty configuration).
Check the corresponding statefulset and events.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl --as cluster-admin -n $INSTANCE_NAMESPACE describe sts redis-master
----

=== icon:wrench[] Tune

If this alert isn't actionable, noisy, or was raised too late you may want to tune the SLO.

You have the option tune the SLO through the component parameters.
You can modify the objective, disable the page or ticket alert, or completely disable the SLO.

The example below will set the SLO set the objective to 99.25% and disable the page alert.

[source,yaml]
----
appcat:
  slos:
    vshn:
      redis:
        uptime:
          objective: 99.25
          alerting:
            page_alert:
              enabled: false
